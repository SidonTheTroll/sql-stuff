Databases can be stored in different ways:
    On paper 
    In mind
    On a computer 

Computers are great for storing databases because it can store millions of lines of information in the memory 



Database Management Systems (DBMS)
> A special software program that helps users create and maintain a database. 
    Makes it easy to manage large amounts of information
    Handles security 
    Backups 
    Importing/exporting data 
    Concurrency 
    Interact with sofaware applications 


C.R.U.D: Create Read Update Delete 


Types: 

Relational Databases (SQL)
    Organise data into one or more tables 
        Each table has columns and rows 
        A unique key identifies each row 

Non-Relational (noSQL / not just SQL)
    Organize data is anything but a traditional table 
        Key-value stores 
        Documents (JSON, XML, etc)    
        Graphs 
        Flexible Tables 


>>> Relational Database

> Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS)
    Help users create and maintain a relational database 
        Eg.- mySQL, Oracle, postgre, mariaDB, etc. 

> Structured Query Language (SQL)
    Standardized language for interacting with RDBMS 
    Used to perform C.R.U.D operations, as well as other administrative tasks (user management, security, backup, etc)
    Used to define tables nad structures 
    SQL code used on one RDBMS is not always portable to another without modification 


>>> Non-Relational Database (noSQL / not just SQL)

> Non-Relational Database Management Systems (NRDBMS) 
    Help users create and maintain a non-relational database 
        Eg.- mongoDB, dynamoDB, apache cassandra, firebase, etc. 

> Implementation Specific 
    Any non-relational database falls under this category, so there's no set language standard. 
    Most NRDBMS will implement their own language for performing C.R.U.D and administrative operations on the database. 



>>>Database Queries

Queries are requests made to the database management systems for specific information 

As the database's structure becomes more and more complex, it becomes more difficult to get the specific piece of informations we want. 

A google search is a query
